I want you to remember me
When it's all dragged into the sea
Take me back to your memory
I never wanna say good bye
Thinking about what might have been
Now there's no space for an apology
Spinning around in favorite tea
I never wanna say good bye
Today the rain is mean somehow I'm calm
The sound of emptiness makes me so crazy
You can take what's left inside of me
When it's all gonna fall
If you're leaving please don't your hide your
eyes
So that we can cry out
I want you to remember me
When you get lost at 2 past 3
Spinning around in bellyache
I never wanna say good bye
Tomorrow I'll bleed, for now I'm calm
The sound of emptiness drives me so insane
You can take what's left inside of me
When it's all gonna fall
When you see me please don't ask me why
Let it rest in time
You can take what's left inside of me
When it's all gonna fall
If you're leaving please don't your hide your
eyes
So that we can cry out
(Next time you see me)
(Next time you see me)

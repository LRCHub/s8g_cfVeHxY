[00:00.99] Goodnight goodnight
[00:04.52] Leave all your toys
[00:09.08] Candles and cats
[00:12.63] A few stupid boys
[00:15.48] And a rock for good luck
[00:20.85] Two different eyes
[00:25.33] Leave your red birds to sing us lullabies
[00:31.67] And some books and a baby
[00:36.27] A ceiling of gold
[00:39.85] The New York yankees
[00:44.36] And a bottle of snow

Like this pile of trash inside my head
You can let it burn 2 ash and see what's left

I would hope for true love
Not a pair of handcuffs
I would hope for true love
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Weigh this broken drum and let it run
Lick the envelope and cut your tongue

I would hope for true love
Not a pair of handcuffs
I would hope for true love
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

You can kill us all
Yeah you can kill us all
It's the mind, it's the mind of billions of us

You can kill us all
Yeah you can kill us all
It's the mind, it's the mind of billions of us

Well I don't remember how you got away
And the sky and the trees were falling out of place
If I thought you had laughed and knew just what to say
And the stars they were were pulling everyone apart
And the good and the bad were coming to a halt
When the big and the sad they couldn't find a start
And the stars were pulling everything apart

I cannot bear
No one compares
I miss your smile
Sadness all the while

How can it be and I'll never, I'll never know why
I want to be in your imminent elegant light

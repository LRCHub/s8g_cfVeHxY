[00:00.72] With every touch, I'm getting closer to the edge
[00:11.72] With these open wounds, I forgive you
[00:21.23] With every horror, I lose myself along the bend
[00:32.88] In the fog, we become disconnected
[00:49.88] 
[00:43.13] Ash to bone, you come to me
[00:49.40] You're never alone, but soon we'll be
[00:55.02] Strangers in the grey
[01:00.03] Strangers in our own ways

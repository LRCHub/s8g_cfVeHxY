I see fire in your eyes
I see ash and bone
I see rivers running dry
I see your wild ways growing tame
I see your fear

I see freedom
I see freedom in your eyes
I see freedom
I see freedom in your eyes

Run to the edge she said to me
I ran to you, you ran to me
Woven hands and a cool black night
And all I see
Is the freedom in your eyes
All I see
Is the freedom in your eyes

Ahuuu, ahuuu
Ahuuu, ahuuu, ahuuu, ahuuu
I'll stay wild for you
If you'll stay wild for me, too

Ahuuu, ahuuu
Ahuuu, ahuuu, ahuuu, ahuuu
I'll stay wild for you
If you'll stay wild for me, too

You are sweetness, you're bitter
You sting like whiskey
You linger on my breath
Just like the green grass growing back
I feel I'm alive
It's just the freedom
It's the freedom of the wild

All I see
Is the freedom in your eyes
All I see
Is the freedom in your eyes

Ahuuu, ahuuu
Ahuuu, ahuuu, ahuuu, ahuuu
I'll stay wild for you
If you'll stay wild for me, too

Ahuuu, ahuuu
Ahuuu, ahuuu, ahuuu, ahuuu
I'll stay wild for you
If you'll stay wild for me, too

Ahuuu, ahuuu
Ahuuu, ahuuu, ahuuu, ahuuu
I'll stay wild for you
If you'll stay wild for me, too
